# TwoParameterK3
Mathematica worldsheet for article "Enumerative geometry and modularity in two-modulus K3-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds" with Charles Doran, Boris Pioline and Thorsten Schimannek, [arXiv:2408.02994] 
The file dataClean.nb contains the raw data for the 39 models X_{m,s}^{i,j}, as a list of replacements rules for m,i,j,s, Euler number chi, intersection form kappa_abc with a,b,c=1,2, genus g GV invariants n_{g,(k,d)} for g<=2, etc.
The file K3fibClean.nb contains the same raw data as a hidden cell, and various routines allowing to compute the modular generating series for Noether-Lefschetz invariants, GV invariants, etc. Some of the explicit results are collected in Appendix E of loc. cit.
